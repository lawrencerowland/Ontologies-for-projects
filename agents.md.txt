These are various candidate ontologies meant to be be useful namespaces for solving various small and mid sized problems on projects across various domains. The purpose of this repo is to keep track of the various ontologies as they are added or taken away from the repo, to keep nicely indexed, serving up a card index web page via github pages with basic name, description, tags indicating specialist area and applicability, all discerned by the agent parsing the file and learning what the ontology is about. The card index should be filterable by ontology and file type (ttl, owl, rdf, other). the website should serve up google tags and also run its own schema.org for the website it serves up, creating also its own skos taxonomy, which the agent evolves as the ontologies change over time.
